AutoEQ Harman to VDSF Converter

This program adds a Moondrop-like sound signature to any earphones!

Please be aware that the sound quality will be lower than standard AutoEQ, and some earphones may sound extremely poor as a result.

It is designed with the expectation of being used in Wavelet.

Use only graphic EQs that target the Harman curve!
